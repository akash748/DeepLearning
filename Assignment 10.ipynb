    "TensorFlow Serving (TFS) is a framework specifically designed for running ML models in a production environment. Since scoring test data over the internet (or using Internet Protocol in a virtual private network) is arguably the most common model-serving scenario, there needs to be an HTTP or HTTPS endpoint that serves as the “front door” to the model. The client program, which will pass test data to the model, needs to communicate with the model’s endpoint via HTTP. This communication follows the style of the RESTful API, which specifies a set of rules and formats for data sent over HTTP.\n",

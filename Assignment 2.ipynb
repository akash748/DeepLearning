Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit a signal to other neurons. An artificial neuron receives a signal then processes it and can signal neurons connected to it. The \"signal\" at a connection is a real number, and the output of each neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections are called edges. Neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Neurons may have a threshold such that a signal is sent only if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer), to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times."

Take an example to understand the problem. Take the example of a Multi-layered Feed-Forward Network, we have to train an ANN model using some data, so that it can classify a new data set, say p_5(3,-2). Say we have deduced that p_1=(5,2)   and  p_2 = (-1,12)   belonging to class C1 while p_3=(3,-5)   and p_4 = (-2,-1)  belonging to class C2. We assume the values of synaptic weights w_0,w_1,w_2 as -2, 1/2 and 1/4 respectively. But we will NOT get these weight values for every learning problem. For solving a learning problem with ANN, we can start with a set of values for synaptic weights and keep changing those in multiple iterations. The stopping criterion may be the rate of misclassification < 1% or the maximum numbers of iterations should be less than 25(a threshold value). There may be another problem that, the rate of misclassification may not reduce progressively."
